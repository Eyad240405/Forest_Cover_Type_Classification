# Forest Cover Type Classification Multi-Class Modeling with Random Forest & XGBoost
## Introduction
Built a predictive model to classify forest cover types using the UCI Covertype dataset, which contains over 580,000 instances and 54 cartographic and environmental features. The system leverages tree-based algorithms to identify forest types based on terrain, soil, and wilderness characteristics. Combined preprocessing, model tuning, and interpretability techniques to deliver scalable, high-accuracy predictions.
## Key Features
• 	Multi-class classification using Random Forest and XGBoost
• 	Feature standardization and categorical encoding for clean input
• 	GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization
• 	Confusion matrix visualization to assess class-wise performance
• 	Feature importance analysis to interpret model decisions

## Tools & Techniques
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Seaborn, Plotly
GridSearchCV, Confusion Matrix, Feature Importance, Data Preprocessing

## Overview
Developed a scalable classification pipeline capable of handling high-dimensional geospatial data. Demonstrated the effectiveness of tree-based models in environmental prediction tasks. Achieved 95% accuracy with Random Forest, outperforming XGBoost at 87%, especially in minority class prediction. This project highlights the impact of tuning and interpretability in building reliable ML systems.
